## **Flare Data Verification 🚀**  

### **🔍 Overview**  
Flare Data Verification is a system that validates off-chain data using multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). The system fetches external data, runs computations on it, and determines its accuracy before presenting a verifiable proof.

## **🛠️ How It Works**  

### **1️⃣ Data Ingestion**  
- Off-chain data (news, finance, weather, research, etc.) is fetched from APIs.  
- Multiple sources are compared for accuracy.  

### **2️⃣ Computation Using LLMs**  
- Different LLMs (GPT-4, Mistral, LLaMA, Command R+) analyze the data.  
- They check for **consistency, credibility, and source validation**.  

### **3️⃣ Verification via TEEs & ZK-Proofs**  
- A **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)** ensures secure computation.  
- **ZK-Proofs (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)** validate the result without revealing full data.  

### **4️⃣ Result & On-Chain Proof**  
- If data is verified, it is marked ✅ **Correct**.  
- If data is unreliable, it is marked ❌ **Incorrect**.  
- A cryptographic proof is generated and stored on-chain.
